## Personal Information 
**Name:** Anthony Clarke

**Student ID:** s3735663

**Student Email:** s3735663@student.rmit.edu.au

**Languages:** English, Indonesian (Very Basic), Tetun (Currently Learning), Thai (Very Little) 

**Nationality:** AUS (Mother Thai, Father English) 

**Education:** Year 12 and just starting Uni

**Basic Background:** Currently living in East Timor for 2 years with my partner, I was living in Canberra Before this year. Currently working part time and studying part time as well. My Hobbies include Computer games, any sports, gym and building computers. My Favourite Hobby would be soccer although I haven’t played in a couple years due to work and living circumstances. 

## Interest in IT
**What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).** 

Always been interested in IT, I build my first computer a couple years ago and loved it so much, would love to keep building PC’s but they are quite expensive, slowly looked further into how a computer worked and how programs worked in computers which made me want to learn more. My Interest started when I started using a computer and all the functionality it had and the progression that has come from when I started to this current date has been incredible. As stated above I have built my own PC and have assisted several friends in building theirs. I have done some programming only with Java and Python and am keen to learn more but I find it rather hard to learn at the moment. I also have a decent understanding of the components of a PC and how they each part works. 

**Why did you choose to come to RMIT?**

I chose RMIT as I wanted to Study IT part time while I was at full time work also for a future career following one of my passions.  I’ve also heard good things about RMIT and know several friends that have studied through RMIT and for my current situation of living overseas it was ideal for me to go with RMIT. 

**What do you expect to learn during your studies?**

I except to learn as much as I can from the subjects and the lecturers and further enhance my skills and knowledge that I already. I hope to fully grasp Programming as it’s such an essential skill in the IT world. 

## Ideal Job

**The job advertisement itself. Including a link, and a snapshot of it (in case the link expires before the assignment deadline).**

My ideal job would have to be IT support. This job entails assisting end users whether over the phone, via email, or in person and also entails daily operations and maintenance of all IT systems including workstations, printers, networks and so on.

**A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.**

A job like this is essential to all companies and provides a good base for an IT career. It allows people to start from the basics and provides essential skills and knowledge in all aspects of IT. One of the most appealing aspects of this job is it opens up doors to a bunch of other IT jobs and gives you a taste of every aspect so you can follow something you truly enjoy. 

**A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.**

This is entirely dependent on the company, some ask for people with little skills, qualifications and experience are required as they will train you from scratch to work with the software/hardware that they use. Where as some companies will want skilled experience workers to just jump straight in and start working with the software/hardware they know. 

**A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.**

Currently I have an understanding of how to build/maintenance on a desktop, a very basic understanding of networking and a basic understanding of programming. I can troubleshoot basic issues with a computer and can communicate with others and work as a team. 

**A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.**

I plan to complete a bachelor in IT and further and further work on skills like programming. I also plan to do other IT courses possibly through CompTia and Cisco. Hopefully these will provide me with enough qualifications and skills to obtain a job in IT support to start my IT career.  

## Personal Profile 

**Results of an online Myers Briggs test.**

<img src="Myers-Briggs-test.png">

The results in this test are a good representation of myself, I am very introverted, very reliant on myself and a very hand on person. The results don’t mean a great deal to me as I already have a good understanding of who I am although it is nice to see what traits a quiz can provide to you, most being right and some being a little off.

These results won’t affect my behaviour in a team, as my everyday life at work consists of working in part of a team and contributing to various team tasks. Also having sports as a hobby, they are all team orientated and without a team you can’t beat another team by yourself. 

Taking this into account I believe I will fit into a group quiet easily and am happy to not be in control of the task at hand but still contribute as much and as often as I can to assist my fellow team mates. I may prefer to work along with people of the same or similar personality traits as me but I often get along with everyone so it shouldn’t be a big deal. 

**Results of an online learning style test.**

<img src="Learning-style.png">

The results of this exam mean quite a bit as during my time at school I found it quite hard to learn in the majority of class rooms as it was just sat down and read or listen the whole time. But in the more practical classes I achieved better marks and thoroughly enjoyed those classes more. As I’d already done this test previously, I’ve been aware that I’m a practical learner. 

The results of this test shouldn’t play a major role in my behaviour in a team as the quiz is intended towards Learning Styles. 

Again, it might be better to find/join a group with the same learning styles and personality traits as me so we can assist each other.  

**Results of one further online test of your choosing**

<img src="Big-5.png">

This test was a Big Five Personality Test. The results given align well with the Myers Briggs Test. Again, the results don’t mean a whole lot, but it is nice to see what 2 different tests can provide such similar results for a user’s personality and shows that a lot of work has gone into these quizzes to provide roughly the same results. 

These results shouldn’t affect my influence as a team like stated above. 

Much a like the results in the Myers Briggs test, I believe I will fit into a group with no issues and hopefully bring something of use to the team. Much like the other 2 I may prefer to work alongside people with the same personality / learning traits and styles.
